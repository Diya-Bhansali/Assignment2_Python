Assignment 2
Task 1:
The program asks the user to enter an integer number.
The user provides a number using the keyboard.
The program then checks the number using a decision-making process (if-else statement).
It checks whether the number is divisible by 2.
Based on the result of this check:
If the number is divisible by 2, the program identifies it as an even number.
If the number is not divisible by 2, the program identifies it as an odd number.
Finally, the program displays the result on the screen, informing the user whether the number is even or odd.

Task 2:
The program uses a loop that starts from the number 1 and continues up to 50.
The loop goes through each number one by one in this range.
During each step of the loop, the program adds the current number to a running total (sum).
This means the program keeps increasing the total by adding each number as the loop progresses.
After the loop finishes (when it reaches 50), the program has the final total sum of all the integers from 1 to 50.
Finally, the program displays the calculated sum on the screen.
